# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis: 
The purpose of this project is to use the given resources on schools and students to analyze each school's performances and the relations between schools' performance and each school's budget and size. The analysis was conduct twice due to the potential of dishonesty on Thomas High School ninth graders. 

## Results:
* The percentage of passing math and reading fells about 1 % after taking out the scores of the Thomas High School's ninth grader from the calcuations.

* The school ranking remains the same without the calcuations from the Thomas High School's ninth graders.
* Replacing the ninth graders' math adn reading scores with NaN had led the entire school district and Thomas High School's overall passing percentage down to about 65%, and Thomas High School was not ranked in the top 5 school.
* Within the same school, the math and reading scores in different grades vary by 1-2%. 
* From the analysis, the students' academic score doesn't go up with a higher school spending. However, the school performance varies dramtically with a different school size and type of schools. The analysis shows that charter school and schools with smaller populations seem to have better academic performance.

## Summary: 
The overall passing, average math and reading scores, and school ranking have been so much different after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs. However with the deeper analysis on the 10th to 12th grade for Thomas High School, we excluded the ninth graders' scores from the calcuation to have a more fair report.
